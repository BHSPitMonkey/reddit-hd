Reddit HD
=========

Reddit HD is an application for Boxee that provides a nice
big-screen interface for Reddit.com.

Reddit HD is not to be confused with Reddit.TV, another Reddit
application for Boxee.


Project Status
--------------

Reddit HD is currently pre-pre-alpha software.
It currently displays a list of the top 15 posts
from reddit.com/r/videos and enables playback 
of most of them.  The settings and login buttons
do nothing;  All you can do right now is refresh.

Attribution
-----------

User mellort deserves plenty of credit for making the 
Reddit API wrapper used by Reddit HD, found here:

https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api

And, obviously, none of this would matter without the 
great Reddit.com community and admins.


Contributing
------------

Contributions will always be welcome! Fortunately, GitHub
makes this process very easy. Just fork this project and
create a Pull Request when you're done making this application
more awesome.


License
-------

This project's code is made available under the same license
as Boxee itself, as this is required for all apps who hope
to seek official distribution.
